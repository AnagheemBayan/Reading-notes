# Functional programming :
a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs

##   function is pure or not?
1. It returns the same result if given the same arguments

1. It does not cause any observable side effects

# Filter
we want to filter by an attribute.The filter function expects a true or false value to determine if the element should or should not be included in the result collection

# Reduce
The idea of reduce is to receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items.
