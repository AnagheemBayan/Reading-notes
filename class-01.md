# How the Web Works:

* When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.


* HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages .

* Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that  lies between their opening and closing tags.


* Attributes Tell Us More About Elements : 

Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign.

## DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using
 
 * The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.

* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.

* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.

* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

### Heading Groups

element is to group together a
set of one or more <h1> through
<h6> elements so that they are
treated as one single heading. "



### Who is the Site For?

target audience"

## WireFrames :

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.
