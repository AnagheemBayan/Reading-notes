* Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.

1. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.

1. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.

1. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.

1. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.

1. Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.


# Tables :
* contain :

1. A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the tr element.

1. Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the td element (or th if it is a header)



# function :

group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
