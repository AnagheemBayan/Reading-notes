# summery of Lists, Tables and Forms

* In addition to the CSS properties covered in other
chapters which work with the contents of all elements,
there are several others that are specifically used to
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

*  List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.

* Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.

*  Forms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.

*  Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.

# events : events are "things" that happen to HTML elements

* an HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

* Here are some examples of HTML events:

*  An HTML web page has finished loading
*  An HTML input field was changed
* An HTML button was clicked
