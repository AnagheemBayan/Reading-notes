# Transforms:
* new ways to position and alter elements.

* The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. 

# 2D Transforms:
Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes.

 three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth.


 * 2D Rotate:provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise.

 * 2D Scale:hange the appeared size of an element. The default scale value is 1, therefore any value between .99 and .01 makes an element appear smaller while any value greater than or equal to 1.01 makes an element appear larger.



 * 2D Translate:a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.


 * 2D Skew: is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both.

 # 3D Transforms:

 * 3D Rotate:
 With three-dimensional transforms we can rotate an element around any axes. To do so, we use three new transform values, including rotateX, rotateY, and rotateZ.


* 3D Scale:
By using the scaleZ three-dimensional transform elements may be scaled on the z axis.


## Transitions & Animations:

1. Transitions: an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

There are four transition related properties including: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-dela

# Animations Keyframes
To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.
