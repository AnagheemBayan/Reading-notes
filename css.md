# Introducing CSS 

* CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear.

## The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.


* A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

1. selector : Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to.
The same rule can apply to
more than one element if you
separate the element names
with commas.


1. declaration : Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled.
Declarations are split into two
parts (a property and a value),
and are separated by a colon



### colors :

The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:


| ways  |           describtion                                                      |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------         |
|  rgb values |    These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up                                                                 |
|  hex codes  | These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80                                                                  |
|  color names   |    There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers                                                              |
