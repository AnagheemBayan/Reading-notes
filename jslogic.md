# LOGICAL OPERATION AND LOOPS  :

* Evaluating Conditions 

| operators| describtion|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ==   | 'is equal to ' to compare two values to see if they are the same |
| !=  | 'is't equal to' compare two values to see if the are not the same   |

| === | 'strict equal to' compare two values to check that both the data type and value are the same |
|!== | 'strict not to equal to' compare two values to check that both data type and value are not the same |

## Logical operator :

* comparison operators usually return single value of (T and F ),logical operator allow you to compare the result of more then one comparison operators .

| logical operator | name |

| &&  | logical and |
| OR"||"  | logical or |
| !   | logical not |

# loops :
check condition ,if returns true , a code block will run .

## Thre common types of loops :

1. FOR :

if you wants to run a cde specific numbers of time 

1. WHILE :

if you don't know how many times the code should run .

1. DO WHILE :

is very similer to while but has one key differences , it will always run the statement inside the curly braces at least once , even if the condition evaluates false .


## loop counters : this instruct the code to run specified numbers of time .

var i = 0 __> initialization 

;

i< 10  __>  condition 

;

i++ __> increment / decrement operator
